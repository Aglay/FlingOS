              GPT stands for GUID Partition Table (where GUID means Global Unique IDentifier).
              GPT is a method for splitting a disk up into sections (partitions) each of which
              is uniquely identified by its ID. Each partition also has a type ID which uniquely
              identifies the type of file system within the partition.

          <content>
            <para>
              GPT is fairly simple to understand though an understanding of data layout on a hard
              disk in general is useful advance knowledge. Familiarity with the MBR partitioning
              scheme is also useful as GPT retains (vital) legacy support for MBR.

            <para>
              GPT is fast becoming the default / most popular way to format hard disks (especially
              in modern laptops / tablets) so it is both important and useful.

              This article will cover background as to what GPT is, where it comes from and what
              problems GPT solves which previous partitioning scheme failed to. This article will
              then move on to a practical understanding of GPT concepts, how GOT organizes data
              on a disk and lastly software implementation details.

          <title>Why are partition tables necessary?</title>
          <content>
            <para>
              Partition tables are necessary because frequently you want more than one file system
              to be physically present on a single disk. You may want multiple file systems simply
              for security and protection or as it allows you to use different file system types.
            </para>
            <para>
              Also, multiple file systems allows you to install multiple operating systems side by
              side on the same disk, so long as both understand the disk formatting (i.e. the
              partition table). This is the case even if the two OSes can't understand eachother's
              file systems.

          <title>What came before GPT?</title>
          <content>
            <para>
              Before GPT there were two partitioning schemes in common use. The main one was MBR
              (Master Boot Record) which remains in use today. GPT has legacy support for MBR since
              MBR is built into nearly every PC boot-sequence in existence.
            </para>
            <para>
              The second significant partitioning scheme was the Apple Partition Map (APM), which was
              in use on Apple's PowerPC based hardware. They have subsequently switched to GPT on their
              Intel based hardware. However, Intel Macs do have support for APM.

            <para>
              GPT solves a number of issues, most of which were issues with MBR. The key issues tackled
              are:

                <para>
                  GPT allows for a variable bit-lengths for Logical Block Addresses (LBAs) which are used
                  for accessing sectors of data on the disk. This allows larger disks to be support.

                <para>Maximum 4 partitions</para>
                <para>
                  GPT allows a minimum of 128 partitions to be defined in the partition table though more
                  can be added (at the expense of "real" data on the disk).

                <para>
                  GPT improves support for 4096-byte size sectors where as much MBR software only supports
                  (or assumes) MBR partitions to be on 512-byte sector-size disks.

                <para>Partition identification</para>
                <para>
                  GPT uses GUIDs to uniquely identify each partition. This means that no two partitions
                  can become confused by identical naming (or at least, not by the computer).

              <listItem>
                <para>File system identification</para>
                <para>
                  The GPT standard sets out GUIDs to identify all the types of file system which a GPT
                  partition holds. These are well defined and easily accessible values. This an improvement
                  over the often conflicted MBR file system identifiers.

              <listItem>
                <para>Use of CRC</para>
                <para>
                  MBR was easily corrupted and there was no way to detect the corruption other than trying it
                  and failing. Trial-and-error at runtime is a dangerous technique that also leads to security
                  holes.
                </para>
                <para>
                  GPT solves this issue by introducing the use of Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC32s). CRCs allow
                  software to read the GPT header and verify its integrity. If the CRC is wrong then the header
                  is corrupted. The secondary GPT header (which is hopefully not corrupted but must also be
                  checked) can hopefully be used to correct the primary GPT header.

          <title>General partition tables</title>
          <content>
            <para>
              In general a partition table simply splits a disk into one or more logical, contiguous chunks
              of data. What lies within a partition needn't be understood by an OS for it to be able to
              identify the partition. Equally, a partition does not have to contain a conventional file
              system, though more often than not it does. Notably, if a partition does not contain a valid
              file system, it usually means the partition is unformatted or corrupted.
            </para>
            <para>
              Note that an unformatted partition is not the same as an unused partition. Unformatted means
              the partition has a chunk of data assigned to it, but the data itself is not in a valid or
              recognisable format. An unused partition means either the partition entry does not assign
              any data from the disk to that partition or the chunk of data being referred to has no
              partition entry associated with it. The latter case can occur if the total size of partitions
              on the disk doesn't cover the full disk or, where partition size boundaries cause cut off leaving
              unused areas of the disk.

          <content>
            <para>
              GPT has a header structure near the start of the disk which provides global information about
              the GPT. This data includes information such as GOT signature, GPT Version, LBA of the Secondary
              (/Backup/Recovery) GPT Header, Disk GUID, partition table entry size (usually 128 bytes) and more.

            <para>
              The Primary GPT Header is preceded on disk by a "protective" MBR. The protective MBR protects the
              disk from corruption by older software (e.g. old BIOS) which does not understand GPT. The
              protective MBR has a single entry which covers the entire disk (or as much as possible under
              32-bit LBAs).

          <content>
            <para>
              The GUID partition table can be treated as an array of structures. Typically, each entry is a
              structure of 128 bytes but a larger size can be specified in the GPT Header. Each entry has a
              specific format, as presented in the table below in the Data Layout section.
            </para>
            <para>
              Each entry contains the GUID of the partition which should be used to identify the partition
              in all cases. It also contains the GUID of the file system type within the partition. This can
              be compared to the list of IDs provided by the GPT standard to find out the type of file system
              with the partition and thus whether that partition can be read properly or not.
            </para>
            <para>
              Usual information is also included such as first and last LBA of the partition along with

            <para>
              GPT has a reasonable level of redundancy built in to help with data recovery should the disk
              become corrupted. This duplicate information comes in the form of the Secondary GPT Header
              and Secondary GPT Partition Table both of which are located in the opposite order at the end
              of the disk.

              The vast majority of modern OSes support GPT and some of the latest bootloader standards

              GPT has been supported in Windows since Windows Vista. Modern (Intel-based) Macs use GPT by
              default. Linux and, importantly, GRUB have support for GPT along with various Linux drivers
              and applications supporting GPT. A very useful tool for editing GPT is "gparted" on Linux.

            <para>
              The protective MBR resides at the first LBA on the disk (LBA0). If the disk is GPT formatted, it will
              indicate a single partition of type EEh (0xEE) which will cover the "entire" drive. In this situation,
              "entire" actually means as much of the drive as MBR allows, since MBR uses 32-bit LBAs, larger disks
              cannot be fully covered. In any case, the size of the MBR partition should be ignored.
            </para>
            <para>
              If multiple partitions are specified, a lot of software will not treat a partition as GPT even if it
              is marked with 0xEE.
            </para>
            <para>
              For legacy BIOS support (i.e. non EFI/UEFI), the first sector also contains the first stage bootloader.
              For GPT formatted disks, this first stage bootloader must be GPT aware and also not assume a 512-byte
              sector size.

              The primary GPT header is the main copy of the GPT header. If it becomes corrupted, it can be compared

              The primary partition table contains the main copy of the partition table. It can be found at the LBA

              (typically 128). Each entry has a specific format. The actual size of each entry and the number of
              entries can be found in the GPT header. Each entry is usually 128 bytes in size.

              The secondary partition table has the same format as the primary partition table. In normal operation,
              the secondary partition should be identical to the primary partition table. In the event that the disk
              becomes corrupted, the secondary partition can be used to restore the primary partition table. Various
              methods, not discussed here, can be employed for reconciling corrupted primary and secondary partiton
              tables.
            </para>
            <para>
              The secondary partition table is always stored at the end of the disk just prior to the secondary
              header. The starting LBA can be found by reading the Secondary Header and using the Current LBA value.
              You can also verify this value by comparing it to the value of "Last usable LBA + 1" from the primary
              header.

            <para>
              The secondary header has the same format as the primary header. Unlike the Secondary Partition Table,
              it should not be an identical copy of the primary header. It should, however, verify all the data in
              the primary header.
            </para>
            <para>
              The secondary header is stored in the last LBA sectors on the disk. The starting LBA should be read
              from Backup LBA in the primary header. However, in the event that the primary header is corrupted,
              the value can be calculated by subtracting the size of the header from the size of the disk
              (with all size units in whole/integer sectors not bytes).

          <content>
            <para>
              Detecting GPT involves steps of reading and data verification. The GPT specification requires a
              protective MBR and single partition covering the whole of the disk. So the first step of GPT
              detection is to read the first sector of the disk and look for/read the MBR partition table.
            </para>
            <para>
              Software should then verify the MBR is valid/uncorrupted, then check that there is one and only one
              partition, covering as much of the disk as 32-bit LBAs allow. Finally, the single partition should
              have a System ID (see MBR for details) of 0xEE. If all these conditions pass, then the disk may have
              a valid GPT on it.
            </para>
            <para>
              The next step is to read the second sector of the disk (LBA 1). This should be the primary GPT header.
              It should start with the GPT Signature/ID. Software should verify the signature is correct.
            </para>
            <para>
              At this point, software can safely assume a valid GPT partitioning scheme exists on the disk. However,
              software should not assume the headers, partition tables or partitions themselves are not corrupted.

          <content>
            <para>
              The next step software should take is to read in the global GPT data from the primary GPT header. Lazy
              software can assume it is uncorrupted and proceed as normal. Good software will verify the header
              against the secondary header and provide the user with a choice of what to do next in the event that
              the primary header is corrupted.

          <content>
            <para>
              At this stage, good software will check the CRC32 values of the partition tables match the expected
              values. This should be the primary way of detecting a corrupted disk. If either partition table
              is corrupted, the software must decide whether to ignore the error and attempt to use the disk,
              auto-correct the error by some algorithm or, if possible, present the user with a choice. The safest
              option in the event that the user can't be given a choice is to display and error message and abandon
              using the disk. This ensures no further corruption can occur (or at least, no corruption due to
              software. Clearly hardware corruption is still a possibility).

            <para>
              The last thing software should do is read the individual partition entries in the partition table
              and fill in structures to represent these. At this point, the partition structures should be
              passable to other I/O software. Notably, there is no reason why the same partition structure
              cannot be used for representing GPT and MBR partitions for general I/O use.
