# Introduction

## Scope of this article
- General explanation of history of stacks and concepts
- Primary focus on hardware stacks (since they are most relevant to OS Dev)
- Covers setup / use on x86 and MIPS

---

# History

- 1946 : Alan M. Turing proposed (terms "bury" and "unbury") for subroutine calling (subroutines already invented: Konrad Zuse's Z4 in 1945)
- Proposed and patented in 1955/1957 : "Dr. Friedrich Ludwig Bauer and Dr. Klaus Samelson (30 March 1957). "Verfahren zur automatischen Verarbeitung von kodierten Daten und Rechenmaschine zur Ausübung des Verfahrens" (in German). Germany, Munich: Deutsches Patentamt. Retrieved 2010-10-01." (Translated title: "The method of automatically processing coded data and computers for putting the method into practice")
- Stack may have originated from spring-loaded stack of plates
