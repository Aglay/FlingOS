# Introduction

## Overview 
Interrupts, also known as exceptions, traps, gates or (in a debugging context) breakpoints, are an absolute essential to OS development. They are so critical that the vast majority of devices can't even be configured without them. This article will look at what interrupts are and, in a general context, how they are used.

## Scope of this article
Interrupts and how interrupts work varies a lot from architecture to architecture but the basic concepts remain the same. This article will cover general ideas about interrupts. Other articles (e.g. the Interrupts Descriptor Table or Programmable Interrupts Controller articles) cover architecture specific implementations of interrupts.
