# Introduction

## Overview
Displays and graphics covers everything from putting a simple piece of text on the screen to the high-end, hyper-detailed graphics found in games to the HD (or even 4K) video watched on YouTube. Clearly, no single article could hope to cover all these areas in any depth so that is not what this article will attempt.

Instead, it is more important to understand a range of the basic designs and systems that go together to form a picture on the screen and how that picture can be continuously updated. This dates back to the early days of monochrome CRT screens so that is where this article will begin. Hopefully, by the end of it, the reader will have gained sufficient knowledge and understanding that they can begin to think sensibly about how to implement a display and possibly graphics driver and perhaps a video decoder driver (the three things being separate and distinct, as will be explained).

## Scope of this article
As stated, this article does not cover specific display, video or graphics technologies (except where they are used as useful examples). Instead this article will cover the important points of the long history of digital pictures and also provide the knowledge and understanding of theoretical concepts which applied by a wide range technologies.

# History

## Introduction
While it may not seem necessary to know the history of displays, video and graphics, I can assure you it is. Like most areas of computing, the terminology and concepts have developed over time and are now baked into everything. Historical terms (even for things which have totally changed meaning) are everywhere so it's useful to know where they came from. History can also teach us many of the lessons learnt over time particularly with graphics, where there are unobvious cases that lead to bad results.
