# Extent of articles
Any topic, no matter how seemingly small, can be covered in a dissertation of endless length. Such is the nature of any well researched field. However, the FlingOS reference articles are intended for practical use and for learning from, not in-depth theoretical discussion or research. Therefore, the following points are general guidelines for the depth and breadth of article coverage of a topic.

Articles:
1. Must contain sufficient practical, easily extractable information that they are useful to a developer.
  * Excepting articles which are entirely theoretical.
2. Must be concise wherever possible
  * But not at the expense of good grammar.
3. Must contain all technical details required to implement code for the topic in question.
  * Excepting articles which are entirely theoretical.  
4. Must cite all sources used during their production.
  * This should be a *"References"* section at the bottom of the page.
  * Wikipedia and similar are acceptable sources.
5. Should contain a potted history of the topic in question.
  * Enough to provide a modest understanding of the origin and development of the topic.
  * Enough to be able to understand other, more in-depth articles without said articles seeming like totally new information.
6. Should not repeat content covered in other articles - use cross-linking.
  * Except where the content is technical details or similar which would be annoying to have to look up separately.
  * Exceptional cases, as described, must still apply cross-linking to ensure all copies of content are kept up-to-date.
7. Should make use of existing, freely available resources where possible.
  * Ensure licenses permit use.
  * Try to avoid excessive external linking since resources may become unavailable in future.
8. Should contain the bare minimum of code.
  * Use linking to the FlingOS source code for example code.


# Links to tutorials
FlingOS also has a series of tutorials (in the form of videos) which must link to and be linked from the relevant articles. The following lists the tutorials and articles relevant to those tutorials.
